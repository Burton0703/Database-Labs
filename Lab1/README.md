# Laboratory work № 1

## Database design and acquaintance with basic DBMS operations

The purpose of the work is the acquisition of database design skills and practical skills of creating relational databases using MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Task. The work is as follows:

1. Develop a model of "essence-connection" of the subject area, chosen by
   the student independently, in accordance with the item "Requirements for
   the ER-model".
2. Convert the developed model into a database schema (table)
   MySQL or PostgreSQL.
3. Perform normalization of the database schema to the third normal form.
4. Familiarize yourself with the MySQL and phpMyAdmin tools (or
   PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4) and enter a few rows of data into each of
   the tables using phpMyAdmin or pgAdmin 4.

## Conclusion

The ER model will eventually be transformed into a database table structure design. Before you create a database, the ER diagram can make your logic clearer and reduce errors when creating a database.
